        <h2>Placement</h2>
        <p>Founded on the “Win – Win” principle, placement division of PRCE is the vehicle on which valued relationships and collaboration between the college and corporate community are formed thereby promoting partnerships between business and education.
		The Training and Placement cell is headed by the Placement officer and assisted by the placement coordinators from the departments. The placement officer is regularly kept in touch with the corporate to identify their needs and expectations. He is also acting as like a liaison officer between the companies and institute. Placement Cell at PRCE is providing ample opportunities for the young minds to sharpen their intellect and to mould soft sills through regular training programmes, interaction with leaders from industry and academia and industry interface through industrial visits and projects.
